✅ Just finished:
- Updating resume on portfolio and rewording some content

🔧 In progress:
- Grouping skills into Frontend, Backend, Tools/Testing, Workflow & Design categories
- Updating/adding skills and finding appropriate icons

⏭️ Next steps:
- Find a way to visually separate skills into groups (e.g. using <h> tags or section headers)

🧠 Notes:
- Consider subtle dividers or spacing if icons make h-tags feel clunky
- May want to standardize icon sizes (24x24 or 32x32)
